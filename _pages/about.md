I am an undergraduate student in Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran, expecting to graduate in June 2026. My academic focus lies in artificial intelligence, with a particular interest in large language models (LLMs) and their applications.

My research experiences span several domains:

- Human-Robot Interaction: designing multimodal imagination-augmented frameworks to enhance intent recognition in ambiguous scenarios.
- Investor Risk Profiling: creating adaptive LLM-based agents that conduct dynamic, conversational interviews to produce nuanced investor profiles.
- Financial Market Surveillance: developing machine learning systems to detect anomalous trading behaviors linked to insider activity.

Through these projects, I have developed a fascination for the inner workings of LLMs, especially in two directions: enhancing their capabilities with multimodal data and deploying them as agents to address real-world challenges.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy writing songs and playing guitar as a creative outlet, which helps me bring a fresh perspective to my technical work.


## Research Experience

### [MIIRA: Multimodal Imaginative Intent Recognition Agent](/research/miira)

This study presents an innovative framework that equips AI with an imagination module to address uncertainty in human-robot interactions. Drawing inspiration from human thought processes, MIIRA produces internal multimodal simulations—covering narrative, visual, and auditory aspects—based on minimal textual prompts. By supplementing short or vague instructions with imagined context, the system enhances the model’s capacity to interpret intent in complex, underdefined household situations.

My role involved designing and implementing the text expansion pipeline, developing the multimodal simulation modules, and carrying out extensive evaluations across different modality setups.


### [Adaptive LLM Interviews for Investor Risk Profiling](/research/adaptive-llm-risk-profiling)

This project introduced a novel two-agent LLM framework for adaptive investor risk profiling, integrating conversational AI with structured analytical reporting. The system conducts interactive interviews that tailor question difficulty to the user’s knowledge level, examines core risk factors through staged questioning, and produces detailed reports combining numerical evaluations with narrative insights.

My contributions included designing and implementing the analyzer agent, conducting literature review on risk profiling methodologies, and creating the report generation framework.


## Featured Project

### [Detecting Insider Trading Patterns Using High-Frequency Market Data](/projects/insider-trading-detection)

This research tackles ongoing concerns about insider trading in the Iranian stock market by creating an advanced machine learning system designed to flag unusual trading behaviors that occur before major news releases. The study demonstrates how systematic analysis of high-frequency market data can uncover signals aligned with informed trading activity.

As part of a three-person team, my responsibilities included developing new evaluation metrics, creating interactive dashboards in Tableau for visualization, and applying RNN/LSTM models for temporal anomaly detection.


## [Teaching Experience](/teaching)

I have worked as a Teaching Assistant for multiple courses at the University of Tehran, including Engineering Probability and Statistics, Programming Languages and Compilers, and Formal Languages and Automata Theory. In these positions, I have been involved in designing computer and theoretical assignments, running feedback sessions, and supporting students as they navigated challenging technical material.

These roles strengthened my ability to explain technical ideas clearly and deepened my commitment to building collaborative, student-centered learning environments.
