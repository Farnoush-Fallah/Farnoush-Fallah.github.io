Currently serving as a teaching assistant under the supervision of [Dr. Ghassemi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ymM5kfAAAAAJ&hl=en), I am responsible for designing and grading one of the courseâ€™s five homework assignments. My work focuses on context-free grammars and the parsing phase of compilers, ensuring that the assignment is both aligned with course objectives and appropriately challenging for students.
