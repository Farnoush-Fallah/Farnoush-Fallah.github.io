As part of the revised structure of the course, I designed the first homework assignment under the framework introduced by [Dr. Ghassemi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ymM5kfAAAAAJ&hl=en). The assignment was developed to move beyond repetition of lecture material and instead guide students through exploring advanced topics with new resources and step-by-step progression. Recognizing the impact of modern tools such as LLMs and chatbots, I structured the work to encourage their effective use while maintaining academic rigor, helping students engage more deeply and develop independent problem-solving skills.
