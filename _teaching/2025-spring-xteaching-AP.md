As part of the teaching team for Advanced Programming, I collaborated with three peers to design one of the six programming assignments of the course and authored sample code for another project. Following assignment submissions, I conducted individual 30-minute feedback sessions with each student, reviewing their repositories, discussing their design choices, and ensuring they fully understood best practices. These sessions, emphasized by [Dr. Khosravi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b9ib0IYAAAAJ&hl=en) as the most valuable component of the course, focused on teaching students how to write maintainable and clean code. The course, taught in C++, the studentsâ€™ first exposure to an object-oriented language in their second semester, aims to establish strong foundations in object-oriented design. In addition, I contributed to grading the final exam. The course enrolls approximately 130 students each spring.
