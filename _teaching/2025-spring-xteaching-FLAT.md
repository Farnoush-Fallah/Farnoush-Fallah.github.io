Formal Languages and Automata Theory (Spring 2025)
As a teaching assistant under the supervision of [Dr. Mousavi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tHxI7F8AAAAJ&hl=en), I was responsible for designing and grading a homework assignment focused on regular languages and the pumping lemma. The assignment was designed to strengthen studentsâ€™ understanding of fundamental proof techniques in automata theory.
