Together with my sister, I developed demonstration projects that served as simplified versions of the actual programming assignments, providing students with clear examples of how to approach each stage of the work. As part of the course, we designed a simple programming language from scratch and implemented a compiler to translate it into Jasmine bytecode across four phases. Two phases were presented directly [by Dr. Tavassoli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GODPpvgAAAAJ&hl=en), while we presented the remaining phases to the students. In addition, we provided technical support by answering studentsâ€™ questions and helping them resolve errors during assignment development. I also contributed approximately ten pages of documentation for the object-oriented design of the new programming project introduced as a student assignment.
