In collaboration with my brother, I developed a series of demonstration projects that provided students with simplified yet instructive models of the programming assignments. As part of the course, we designed a new programming language and implemented a compiler to translate it into Jasmine bytecode across four phases. While two phases were presented by [by Dr. Tavassoli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GODPpvgAAAAJ&hl=en), I presented the remaining phases to the students, offering detailed explanations and guidance. I also provided technical support during assignment development, assisting students with debugging and resolving design errors.
