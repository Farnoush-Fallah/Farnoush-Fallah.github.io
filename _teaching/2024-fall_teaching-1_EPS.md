As a teaching assistant for a joint course offered to computer and electrical engineering students, I was tasked with designing and grading one of the homework assignments, taken by around 150 students. In addition, I contributed to grading the midterm exam. This work was carried out under the supervision of [Dr. Tavassolipour](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oVAT1lYAAAAJ&hl=en) (Computer Engineering cohort) and [Dr. Vahabie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Gk4iZdUAAAAJ&hl=en) (Electrical Engineering cohort).
