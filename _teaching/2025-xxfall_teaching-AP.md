In my second term as a Teaching Assistant for Advanced Programming, I was assigned a supervisory role for one of the major assignments. In this capacity, I organized and led a team of six TAs responsible for designing the assignment, developing comprehensive test cases to evaluate the correctness of student submissions, preparing sample code to guide students, and conducting individual feedback sessions. I also personally held feedback sessions to ensure that students not only completed their projects but also internalized best practices in coding style and maintainability. Additionally, our team launched a student magazine project aimed at introducing more advanced programming concepts in an accessible and engaging format.
