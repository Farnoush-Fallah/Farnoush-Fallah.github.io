This semester, I am assisting in the joint EPS course offered to computer and electrical engineering students. My responsibilities include designing one of the homework assignments as well as grading a quiz based on that assignment. This role is carried out under the supervision of [Dr. Bahrak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1IdcoLMAAAAJ&hl=en) (Computer Engineering cohort) and [Dr. Vahabie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Gk4iZdUAAAAJ&hl=en) (Electrical Engineering cohort).
